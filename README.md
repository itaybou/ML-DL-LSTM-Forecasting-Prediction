<h2>Q1-2. PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring dataset </h2>
</div>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>
The PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring dataset contains data of 18 different physical activities (such as walking, cycling, playing soccer, etc.), performed by 9 subjects wearing 3 inertial measurement units and a heart rate monitor. The dataset can be used for activity recognition and intensity estimation, while developing and applying algorithms of data processing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification.
</p>

<h3>Task Description</h3>
<p>
The PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring dataset contains data of 18 different physical activities, performed by 9 subjects wearing 3 inertial measurement units and a heart rate monitor. Our goal is to classify timeseries window measurments from induviduall activities to type of activity the measurments were taken from.

    <h2>Q3. Corporación Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting </h2>
    </div>
    
<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>
Brick-and-mortar grocery stores are always in a delicate dance with purchasing and sales forecasting. Predict a little over, and grocers are stuck with overstocked, perishable goods.<br/> Guess a little under, and popular items quickly sell out, leaving money on the table and customers fuming.,
    </p>
    <p>

The problem becomes more complex as retailers add new locations with unique needs, new products, ever transitioning seasonal tastes, and unpredictable product marketing.<br/> Corporación Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer, knows this all too well. They operate hundreds of supermarkets, with over 200,000 different products on their shelves.
</p>

<h3>Task Description</h3>
<p>
Corporación Favorita has challenged the Kaggle community to build a model that more accurately forecasts product sales.<br/> They currently rely on subjective forecasting methods with very little data to back them up and very little automation to execute plans.<br/> They’re excited to see how machine learning could better ensure they please customers by having just enough of the right products at the right time.
